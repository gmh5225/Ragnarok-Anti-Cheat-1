## Introduction

Welcome to the Anti-Cheat Proof of Concept (POC) and Anti-Virus Solution project. Originally intended as an Anti-Cheat system for Activision-based games, the project has evolved into a versatile Anti-Virus solution with a primary focus on user mode operations. Future plans include delving into kernel-level functionality to enhance security further.

Please note that this project is not a "Copy-Paste" repository. You won't be able to clone and build the project as-is. Instead, it serves as a valuable reference for developers looking to incorporate anti-debugging, anti-virtual machine, import obfuscation, and data encryption techniques into their own projects.

**Current Date: 9/9/23** - The project structure might appear messy at the moment, as I am still working on defining a solid organization. The GitHub repository link provided here is also listed on my resume, and I prefer not to change it, necessitating ongoing updates and improvements.

## Project Overview

The project primarily consists of C++ code and aims to provide robust security measures against various threats. Below, you'll find an overview of its core elements:

## Project Structure

The project structure is currently undergoing refinement to ensure better organization and clarity. I am working to create a more coherent layout. Please bear with us during this transition.

## Security Layers

Our project incorporates several security layers to protect against potential threats:

- **Anti-Debugging**: Detects and thwarts debugging attempts to prevent reverse engineering.
- **Anti-Virtual Machine**: Identifies and responds to execution within virtual machine environments.
- **Import Obfuscation**: Conceals the import table, making it harder for malicious actors to understand the code's dependencies.
- **Data Encryption**: Ensures sensitive data remains secure by encrypting it within the application.

## Usage

To use this project as a reference for your own development, simply clone the repository and explore the codebase. I recommend studying the implementation of security layers and adapting them to your specific requirements.
